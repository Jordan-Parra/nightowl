##Development Environment Setup
We recommend developers to use the online [Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io/) to get their development environment up and running fast. 

1. Sign up for an account at [c9.io](https://c9.io/)
2. Login (This will take you to your Cloud9 dashboard)
3. In the top left corner, click the "CREATE NEW WORKSPACE" button and select "Create a New Workspace"
4. In the dialog box that appears:
 * Name your workspace whatever you want (e.g. couche-board, flaming-scrubland, etc.)
 * Select the "custom" square tile option, which has a picture of an apple on it (**warning**: _don't_ select the rails    square tile)
 * Leave everything else as-is and click "CREATE"
5. Click on your newly created workspace listed under the "My Projects" tab, which is located along the side of your      Cloud9 dashboard.
6. Click the green "START EDITING" button to load your workspace in a seperate browser tab
7. In the linux terminal that is located along the bottom of your new workspace, type the following commands:  
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/asu-cis-capstone/nightowl
   $ cd nightowl
   $ bundle install
   ```
   
   Once you completed all these steps, you should be good to go!
