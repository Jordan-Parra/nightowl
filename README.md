##Development Environment

For the sake of a consistent environment, we recommend that you use the browser-based IDE, [Cloud9](https://c9.io/), as your development environment.

Here is list of instructions to get started with Cloud9:

1. Sign up for an account at [c9.io](https://c9.io/)
2. Go to your dashboard
3. Click the "Create New Workspace" button in the top left and select "Clone From URL"
4. In the dialog box that appears:
 * Enter https://github.com/asu-cis-capstone/nightowl into the Source URL field
 * Leave every other field as-is
 * Click "Create"
5. Wait for Cloud9 to provision your new workspace
6. Select your workspace from the left-hand navigation
7. Click "START EDITING"
8. Switch to the new tab where your workspace is loaded
   
Before you start to work with our rails applciation, make sure to run the following command in the terminal:
```
$ bundle install
```
This will install the dependencies that our project rely on.

On that note, you are good to go!
